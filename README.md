# [Tools for Data Science - IBM Professional Data Science Certification](https://www.ibm.com)

This repository contains the project completed as part of the "[Tools for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science)" course, which is a requirement for the [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Professional Data Science Certification program.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the creation of a Jupyter Notebook, insertion of both code and markdown cells, and the process of sharing the notebook through GitHub.

## Objectives:
- **Create a Jupyter Notebook** to showcase data analysis tasks.
- **Insert Code Cells**: Implement Python code for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Insert Markdown Cells**: Write descriptive text to explain the code, document the workflow, and present results.
- **Share on GitHub**: Push the notebook to GitHub, making it publicly available for collaboration or as a portfolio project.

## Structure of the Repository:
1. `DataScienceEcosystem/` - Contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the project.
